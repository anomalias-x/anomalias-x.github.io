The goal of this project was to do an article to a magazine which the main piece was a labyrinth about lifeâ€™s evolution (from the beginning of life to the human being). The shape of the labyrinth, as the colors, have a profound meaning for the topic addressed, helping to tell the story at a deeper level.
After a brief introduction, the reader is invited to unravel the labyrinth, as if he was also traversing the path of evolution traced from the first sign of life to the human being.
