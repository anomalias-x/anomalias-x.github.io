The challenge was to make a bifold with special cuts (inside and outside cut) and the obligatory theme was a movie of our choice. The personal goal I set for this project was to tell E.T.’s story in eleven steps using infographics, because... who doesn’t love the story of E.T. and his human friend, Elliot? The inner cut of the bifold was used to represent the final feeling of the film: when E. T. leaves for his planet, his heart stays with Elliot on Earth.
