This project was born from the merge of The book of imaginary beings (Jorge Lu√≠s Borges) and the book of Invisible Cities (Italo Calvino). There was a selection of six short stories from each of the books and then the selected stories were paired together - one from the first book and one from the second book. The result was a set of six illustrations where two imaginary worlds co-exist in each illustration, creating a third (visual) narrative. The illustrations are dioramas of recycled paper with pen drawings, indian ink and print text. Each illustration was photographed and gathered in a book.

Note: The texts appearing in the illustrations and on the book's pages are from the authors of the mentioned books. Therefore, I own no rights over it.
